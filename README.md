# pythonapirepo

A lightweight Python API project designed for rapid development and deployment of RESTful services. This repository serves as a foundational template for building scalable and maintainable Python-based APIs.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Organized codebase promoting separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Management**: Utilizes `requirements.txt` for easy package management.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Includes a `render.yaml` GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment.
- **Pythonic Design**: Emphasizes readability and simplicity, adhering to Python best practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/infisble/pythonapirepo.git
   cd pythonapirepo
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

Execute the main script to start the API service:

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, the application runs on `http://localhost:8000`. You can modify the host and port settings within `main.py` as needed.
